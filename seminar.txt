Title: Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation using Machine Learning: A Comprehensive

Study




Abstract:

This paper explores the application of machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree,

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes, for

disease prediction and drug recommendation. Using a diverse dataset, we develop a system that

accurately predicts diseases and recommends medications. Experimental results demonstrate the

effectiveness of these algorithms in improving healthcare outcomes.




Background:

Machine learning and data analytics advancements have enabled innovative solutions in

healthcare. Disease prediction and drug recommendation play vital roles in patient care and

healthcare efficiency. Our research aims to automate disease prediction and assist healthcare

professionals in making informed decisions using machine learning algorithms.




Problem:

This study addresses challenges in disease prediction, misdiagnosis, and wrong prescription.

Accurate prediction is crucial, but misdiagnosis and wrong prescriptions can occur due to various

factors. Advanced machine learning techniques are needed to improve accuracy, reduce

misdiagnosis, and provide accurate drug recommendations.
Experiment/Dataset:

In order to assess the effectiveness of our proposed system, we employed a comprehensive dataset

sourced from Kaggle, consisting of curated medical records.

Disease Dataset

The dataset consists of two CSV files: one for training and one for testing the model. Each file

contains 133 columns, where 132 columns represent symptoms and the last column represents the

prognosis. The symptoms are mapped to 42 diseases.

Drug Dataset

The drugs dataset consists of a single CSV file with 4 columns. Three columns represent age,

disease, and gender, while the last column indicates the corresponding drug. A total of 9 diseases

are mapped to 4955 drugs in this dataset.

We apply Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine,

and Naive Bayes algorithms.




Results:

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the employed machine learning algorithms

for disease prediction and drug recommendation. The models achieve high accuracy, precision,

recall, and F1-score, indicating their ability to identify diseases accurately.

Recommendation:

Integrating the disease prediction and drug recommendation system in healthcare institutions is

recommended. This integration improves diagnoses, reduces errors, and enhances patient

outcomes. Future research should explore additional algorithms and address ethical

considerations, data privacy, and model interpretability.
